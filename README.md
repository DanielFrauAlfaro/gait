# GAIT (Gesture Analysis and Interpretation Toolkit)

Welcome to the GAIT (Gesture Analysis and Interpretation Toolkit) repository for EI (Entornos Inteligentes) subject! This repository includes all scripts written for processing and analysing different marching pathrons. In addition to pure gait classification pipelines, this repository also includes the analysis of psychological traits of the person being filmed using [Psymo dataset](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2024/papers/Cosma_PsyMo_A_Dataset_for_Estimating_Self-Reported_Psychological_Traits_From_Gait_WACV_2024_paper.pdf).

## Features

- **Gesture Preprocessing**:
  - Normalize and preprocess raw sensor data.
  - Extract key features from gesture signals.

- **Gesture Representation**:
  - Convert raw sensor data into gesture representations suitable for analysis.

- **Gesture Analysis**:
  - Implement algorithms for gesture segmentation and recognition.
