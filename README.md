# GAIT (Gesture Analysis and Interpretation Toolkit)

Welcome to the GAIT (Gesture Analysis and Interpretation Toolkit) repository! GAIT is a Python-based toolkit designed for analyzing and interpreting gestures captured from various sensors, such as accelerometers or motion capture devices. This toolkit provides a range of functionalities for processing, visualizing, and understanding gesture data.

## Features

- **Gesture Preprocessing**:
  - Normalize and preprocess raw sensor data.
  - Extract key features from gesture signals.

- **Gesture Representation**:
  - Convert raw sensor data into gesture representations suitable for analysis.

- **Gesture Analysis**:
  - Implement algorithms for gesture segmentation and recognition.
  - Compare and classify gestures using machine learning techniques.

- **Visualization**:
  - Visualize gesture data, features, and analysis results using plots and animations.

## Installation

To use GAIT, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gait.git
